## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Quickly add new tasks to your to-do list.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks that are no longer needed.
- **Task Completion**: Mark tasks as complete to keep track of your progress.
- **Persistent Storage**: The app uses local storage to save your tasks, so they remain even after refreshing the page.

2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
3. Start managing your tasks by adding new items to the list.
4. Delete tasks as needed.

## How It Works

The app uses JavaScript to handle task management, including adding and deleting tasks. Tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, ensuring that your list remains intact even after the page is refreshed or closed.
